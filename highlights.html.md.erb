<!--- This list comes from combining, selecting, and summarizing all the release notes, and punching them up a bit, informed by marketing -- see the Wiki https://docs-wiki.cfapps.io/wiki/team/release-manager.html#feature-highlights -->

This topic highlights important new features included in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v<%= vars.current_major_version %>.

## <a id='om'></a> PCF Operations Manager (Ops Manager) Highlights

Ops Manager v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='azure-az'></a> Native Support for Azure Availability Zones

Ops Manager natively supports Azure AZs, in available regions, for clean installs of PAS 2.5.x. The AZ approach is an easier and better choice, compared to availability sets, the prior implementation.

### <a id='manifest-diff'></a> View a Diff of Proposed Changes to a Manifest

Ops Manager includes a diff view of proposed changes to a given manifest. This allows operators to easily review and understand changes to the manifest.

### <a id='automation'></a> Use Ops Manager Automation Features

Operators can now use the full automation capabilities of Ops Manager when SAML/LDAP is enabled. Previously, human intervention was required in this scenario.

## <a id='pas'></a>Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Highlights

PAS v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='weighted-routing'></a> Istio-Based Routing Subsystem Enables Weighted Routing (Beta)

Operators can deploy an Istio-based routing subsystem with PAS v2.5 that allows developers to use weighted routing. Weighted routing gives developers more control over the percentage of traffic forwarded to each app mapped to a route.

### <a id='multiple-ports'></a> Support For Apps That Require Multiple Custom Ports

PAS v2.5 adds support for apps that require multiple ports or ports other than `8080`.

### <a id='app-policies'></a> Configure App Policies in the cf CLI

Developers can use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to configure app policies across spaces in their deployment. This allows developers to more quickly manage and configure app policies.

### <a id='app-policies'></a> Disable Container-to-Container Networking Policies

Operators can disable container-to-container networking policies. This allows for communication across all apps without the need to configure numerous container-to-container networking rules. 

### <a id='metadata'></a> Specify Metdata for Apps, Orgs, and Spaces 

Operators can add labels and annotations to elements throughout PAS, including apps, orgs, spaces, and more. Metadata such as environment information, billing codes, points of contact, and information about security or risk make it easier to operate, monitor, and audit PAS deployments. For more information about using metadata in PAS, see [Using Metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/adminguide/metadata.html).

<!-- leaving out PAS for Windows for now -->

## <a id='apps-man'></a> Apps Manager Highlights

Apps Manager v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='multi-foundation'></a> Support for Multi-Foundation Deployments (Beta)

Apps Manager includes support for multi-foundation deployments. This allows users to search, view, and manage applications across all foundations from a single interface.

### <a id='async-bindings'></a> Asynchronous Bindings

Apps Manager supports asynchronous bindings, Asynchronous bindings allow service brokers more time to perform the operations required to complete a bind. This can help service brokers avoid timing out for synchronous operations in PAS.
