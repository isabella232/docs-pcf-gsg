<!--- This list comes from combining, selecting, and summarizing all the release notes, and punching them up a bit, informed by marketing -- see the Wiki https://docs-wiki.cfapps.io/wiki/team/release-manager.html#feature-highlights -->

This topic highlights important new features included in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v<%= vars.current_major_version %>.

## <a id='om'></a> PCF Operations Manager (Ops Manager) Highlights

Ops Manager v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='manifest-diff'></a> View a Diff of Proposed Changes to the Manifest

A diff view in Ops Manager shows proposed changes to the manifest compared to the state of the manifest in the last successful BOSH Director deployment. This allows you to easily review and understand changes to the manifest before deploying.

For more information, see [diffs](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/opsman-api/#diffs).

### <a id='automation'></a> Additional Support for Ops Manager Automation Features

You can configure a pre-created client account to manage automation tasks and scripts for Ops Manager. Previously, you had to log in to create a client for automated use of Ops Manager.

For more information about Ops Manager users and clients, see [Creating and Managing Ops Manager User and Client Accounts](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/opsman-users.html).

### <a id='azure-az'></a> Support for Microsoft Azure Availability Zones

New installations of Ops Manager include support for Microsoft Azure Availability Zones (AZs). Compared to Azure Availability Sets, AZs provide higher availability, less latency, and more efficient resource management.

For more information, see [Configuring BOSH Director on Azure](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/om/azure/config-manual.html) and [Configuring BOSH Director on Azure Using Terraform](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/om/azure/config-terraform.html).

### <a id='ca-rotation'></a> NATS Certificate Authority Rotatation Through Ops Manager API

Ops Manager allows you to regenerate and rotate the NATS certificate authority (CA).

This feature pairs the lifecycle of the NATS CA with the Ops Manager root CA, meaning the NATS CA and Ops Manager root CA are created, activated, and deleted at the same time.

For more information about generating and rotating certificates, see [Managing Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).

### <a id='vm-extensions'></a> BOSH Director VM Extensions

You can defining custom `vm_extensions` for BOSH Director VMs using the Ops Manager API. VM extensions allow you to specify IaaS-specific configurations for your VMs, such as associated security groups and load balancers.

For more information about VM extensions, see [Managing VM Extensions](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/custom-vm-extensions.html).

## <a id='pas'></a>Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Highlights

PAS v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='weighted-routing'></a> Service Mesh Routing Plane (Beta)

An optional service mesh routing plane enables weighted routing, which gives you greater control over the percentage of traffic forwarded to each app mapped to a given route.

To deploy the service mesh routing plane, navigate to the **Networking - Service Mesh** pane of the PAS tile and select **Enable** under **Service Mesh (Beta)**. 

### <a id='multiple-ports'></a> Support For Apps That Require Multiple Ports (Beta)

PAS v2.5 supports apps that require multiple ports and apps that require custom ports. This update allows additional apps, such as Docker images and apps with TCP protocols that require multiple ports, to run on PAS.

For more information, see [Configuring CF to Route Traffic to Apps on Custom Ports (Beta)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/devguide/custom-ports.html).

### <a id='app-policies'></a> Configure App Policies in the cf CLI

You can use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to configure app policies across spaces in your PCF foundation. This allows you to quickly manage and configure app policies without using the API.

### <a id='app-policies'></a> Disable Networking Policies

You can disable Silk network policy enforcement for all apps in a foundation. This allows apps to send network traffic to all other apps without the need for the operator to manually configure numerous networking rules. 

For more information about Silk, see [silk](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/silk) in GitHub.

### <a id='metadata'></a> Add Metadata to Apps, Orgs, and Spaces 

You can add labels and annotations to elements throughout PAS, including apps, orgs, spaces, and more. Metadata such as environment information, billing codes, and points of contact make it easier to operate, monitor, and audit PAS deployments. 

For more information about using metadata in PAS, see [Using Metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/adminguide/metadata.html).

<!-- Leaving out PAS for Windows for now. PASW is not being released with  PAS v2.5. -->

## <a id='apps-man'></a> Apps Manager Highlights

Apps Manager v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id='multi-foundation'></a> Support for Multiple Foundation Deployments (Beta)

Apps Manager includes support for deployments with multiple PCF foundations. This allows you to search, view, and manage orgs, spaces, apps, and service instances across multiple foundations from a single interface in Apps Manager.

### <a id='async-bindings'></a> Support for Asynchronous Bindings

Apps Manager supports asynchronous bindings. Asynchronous bindings help avoid timeouts for synchronous operations in PAS by allowing service brokers more time to complete a bind.

For more information about managing apps with Apps Manager, see [Managing Apps and Service Instances Using Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html).

## <a id='platform-automation'></a> Platform Automation Highlights

Platform Automation includes the following major features:

### <a id='platform-automation-ga'></a> Platform Automation for PCF is Generally Available

Platform Automation for PCF uses `om` commands, Concourse tasks, and example pipelines to enable teams to create an automated pipeline for upgrading and installing their PCF foundations.

For more information about Platform Automation for PCF, see the [Platform Automation for PCF documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-automation/alpha/index.html).
