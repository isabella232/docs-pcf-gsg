This topic highlights important new features included in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.4.


## <a id='om'></a> PCF Operations Manager (Ops Manager) Highlights

Ops Manager v2.4 includes the following major features:

### <a id="global-cpi"></a> Support for Global CPI Extensions

Ops Manager supports global [cloud provider interface](https://bosh.io/docs/terminology/#cpi) (CPI) extensions. 
You can customize your IaaS deployment using hundreds of different configuration extensions.
This feature unlocks native IaaS features while retaining the inherent portability of PCF.

For more information about this feature, see [Updating Director and IaaS Properties](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#updating-director-and-iaas-properties-experimental).

### <a id="antivirus-boshrelease"></a> BOSH Director Supports Multiple BOSH Releases 

You can specify multiple BOSH releases for the BOSH Director deployed by Ops Manager. 
This feature allows you to deploy your own software, such as your specific antivirus programs, to BOSH-deployed VMs.

For more information about adding BOSH releases to a BOSH Director, 
see [Deploying Software with BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/deploy-bosh-om.html#bosh).

## <a id='ert'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Highlights

PAS v2.4 includes the following major features:

### <a id="zero-downtime"></a> Rolling App Deployments (Beta)

Native rolling `push` and `restart` commands simplify new app deployment.
You no longer need two application versions or client orchestration to achieve rolling app deployments.

For more information about rolling app deployments, see [Rolling App Deployments (Beta)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/devguide/deploy-apps/rolling-deploy.html).

### <a id="dynamic-egress"></a> Create Dynamic Egress Policies (Beta)

You can create dynamic egress policies so your apps can communicate with external services. 
These policies are similar to Application Security Groups (ASGs) but include the following advantages:

* You do not have to restart your apps when applying these policies, so there is no downtime. 
* You can apply them to specific apps. 

For more information, 
see [Administering Dynamic Egress Policies (Beta)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/devguide/egress-policies.html).

### <a id="smb"></a> SMB Volume Services

SMB volume services allow developers to bind existing SMB shares to their apps. 
The SMB protocol has native password authentication, which means you can control 
access to file shares without the overhead of configuring an LDAP server.

For more information about using SMB volume services, 
see [Enable SMB Volume Services](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsguide/enable-vol-services.html#smb-enable) 
and [Using an External File System (Volume Services)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/devguide/services/using-vol-services.html). 

### <a id="metric-registrar"></a> New Metric Registrar Component

The Metric Registrar allows app developers to export custom app metrics and events in a format that Loggregator can consume. App developers can then use the custom metrics to monitor apps with PCF Metrics and configure autoscaling rules with PCF Autoscaler. 

For more information, see the following topics: 

* [Configuring the Metric Registrar](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/metric-registrar/index.html)
* [Registering Custom App Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/metric-registrar/using.html)

### <a id="log-api"></a> Loggregator v2 API is Readable Through RLP Gateway

As a nozzle developer, you can access the Loggregator v2 API through a Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) gateway. You
do not need to manage mutual TLS to access the v2 API.

The Loggregator v2 API supports additional features, including selector-based subscription
models. For more information about that feature, see [Selector-Based Subscripton Model and
Reference
Nozzles](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#selector-based)
in the PAS v2.2 release notes.

### <a id='credhub-ga'></a> Runtime CredHub is GA

CredHub is enabled by default in the PAS tile.
You can scale the number of CredHub instances in the **Resource Config** pane.
In PAS v2.4, the number of CredHub instances defaults to 2.

For more information about CredHub, see the [PAS v2.4 Release Notes
](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#credhub-ga).

### <a id="credhub-db"></a>CredHub Can Use the Same External Database as Other PAS Components

In the PAS v2.4 tile, you can configure CredHub to use the same external database
as other PAS components. The **CredHub** pane of the PAS tile has updated wording
to make this setting clearer.

To use the same database for CredHub and other PAS components, whether the database
is internal or external, select **PAS database** in the **CredHub** pane of the PAS
tile. You configure the database later on the **Databases** pane.

To use a separate external database for CredHub only, select **Other external
database** in the **CredHub** pane of the PAS tile.

For more information, see the PAS installation topic that corresponds to your IaaS:

### <a id='cflinuxfs3'></a> PAS Uses cflinuxfs3 by Default

PAS v2.4 uses the `cflinuxfs3` stack and its related buildpacks by default on new installations. 

For more information, see the [PAS v2.4 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#cflinuxfs3).

### <a id="more-tls"></a> Enhanced Security with TLS-Encrypted Traffic

PAS adds TLS encryption in the following areas:

* Internal MySQL system databases (beta)
* External MySQL databases by providing a CA certificate in PAS
* Communications between Gorouter and Linux cells

Additionally, authenticated containers that use mTLS support `cf ssh` access. 
The previous limitation has been removed.

## <a id='pas-windows'></a> PAS for Windows Highlights

PAS for Windows v2.4 includes the following major features:

### <a id='overcommit'></a> Memory and Disk Overcommit for Diego Cells

You can now enable memory and disk overcommit for Diego cells.
To configure this feature, use the Cell Memory Capacity (MB) and Cell Disk Capacity (MB) fields within the Advanced Features pane of the PAS for Windows (PASW) tile.
For more information on this feature, see the [Configure the Tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/windows/installing.html#config) section of _Installing and Configuring PAS for Windows_.


### <a id='identify-metrics'></a> Uniquely Identify Metrics from PAS for Windows

Metrics emitted from PAS for Windows are now tagged with the BOSH deployment name of your PAS for Windows tile. With a GUID, you can uniquely identify your metrics by tile. In PAS for Windows v2.3 and earlier, metrics use the `cf` tag as the deployment name.

This feature is enabled by default in new deployments of PAS for Windows v2.4. However, for upgrades to PAS for Windows v2.4, the feature is disabled by default. 

For more information on this feature, see the [PAS for Windows Release Notes](https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/windows-rn.html#metrics-prefix).

### <a id='stack'></a> Developers Can Push with Default Windows Stack

Developers can push apps using `cf push -s windows`. Pushing apps with this command ensures that you are pushing with the Windows stack with the latest `rootfs`.

For more information, see [Step 2: Push App to PAS for Windows Cells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/windows/migrating.html) in _Migrating Apps to PAS for Windows_.

### <a id='smb-windows'></a> SMB Support for Windows Containers (Beta)
SMB mounting allows developers to bind existing SMB shares to their containerized apps. 
Previously, SMB shares were only accessible by using the SharpCIFS library. PASW v2.4.0 natively supports SMB mounting.

SMB Mounting is enabled by default when you upgrade to PASW v2.4.0.

SMB Mounting can be utilized with or without Steeltoe. Enabling SMB mounting without Steeltoe requires running the `net use` command.

For more information, see [Using SMB Volumes in .NET Apps](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/windows/smb-volumes-apps.html) in the _.NET on Pivotal Cloud Foundry_ cookbook.

## <a id='apps-man'></a> Apps Manager Highlights

Apps Manager v2.4 includes the following major features:

### <a id="global-search"></a> Global Search

Apps Manager has a global searchbar persistent on every Apps Manager page. With the global
searchbar, you can search org name, space name, service instance name, and app names without
leaving the page.

For more information about Apps Manager, see [Using Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/console/index.html).

### <a id="restage-apps"></a> Restage Apps in Apps Manager

Apps Manager includes a restage button. The button is in addition to the stop and
start buttons on the app management page. Restaging your application stops your
app and restages it by compiling a new droplet and starting it.

For more information about the restage button in the Apps Manager UI, see [Start, Stop, or Restage an App
](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/console/manage-apps.html#start-stop).


### <a id="share-service-instance"></a> Share Service Instances in Apps Manager

You can share service
instances across the spaces you specify. With Space Developer permissions, you
can view, add, and remove service instance sharing.

For more information, see [Service Instance Sharing](../console/manage-apps.html#shared-instances).
