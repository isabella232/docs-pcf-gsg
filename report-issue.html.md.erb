title: Reporting Pre-Release Issues
---

This topic describes how to report and address issues related to Pre-Release, 
Release Candidate, or Beta versions of products for members of the Pivotal 
Early Access Program (EAP). Our goal is to get the most relevant information to 
the Pivotal EAP team so they can address your issue in the quickest and most 
efficient manner possible.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: These early access issues should not be routed through Pivotal Support.</p>

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

Before reporting an issue, we recommend you take the following steps:

1. Review the [Early Access product documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-7/installing/pcf-docs.html). 
To access this documentation, you need a username and password we give to EAP participants.<br/><br/>
    
    Make sure you are looking at the proper release version. We continuously update 
those documents throughout the release process.<br/><br/>

    Not finding what you need? You might also want to see if there is anything in 
our standard product documentation as well. Try searching for the specific 
topic that is related to your issue. Our documentation has search built-in to 
help you more quickly find what you require.

2. Check our [Knowledge Base](https://community.pivotal.io/s/topic/0TO0P000000IKdUWAW/pivotal-application-service). 
Our Knowledge Base contains articles written by Pivotal Support 
Engineers, and addresses many of the common issues we've discovered while 
working with <%= vars.product_name %> customers. You can browse or search the KB articles at the 
link above.

1. Go to your customer Pivotal Tracker project to log an issue. If you do not 
have a Tracker project, reach out to your EAP contact to get one.

## <a id="open-issue"></a>Open an Issue ##

When opening an issue, we recommend the following tips to help us understand 
and address your issue as quickly and effectively as possible:

### <a id="title"></a>Create a Well-Formed Title ###

We recommend that you use a clear and specific one-sentence summary of your 
issue as the **Title** of your Tracker story. For example. "Using Pivotal  
Application Service <%= vars.current_major_version %>.0.alpha2, the API calls return `0` values for running apps metrics."

Like the subject line of an email, or the title of a shared document, a simple 
but clear title can help people identify and recognize the point of a tracker 
story, while a complicated or unclear title can make things harder than they 
need to be. 

### <a id="template"></a>Provide Specific Details ###

We recommend that you use the following template to provide specific details 
about your issue in the **Details** section of your Tracker story: 

<pre>
Ops Manager version (if applicable): 
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) version: 
Other Product(s) and Version(s): 
Enhancement or Bug: 
Summary of the Issue or Situation (attach screenshots as needed): 
Details to reproduce (if needed): 
Additional supporting details: 
IaaS (AWS, Azure, GCP, vSphere or OpenStack): 
Output from running <code>bosh vms</code>: 
Output from running <code>bosh instances</code>: 
Logs (if applicable and you have them): 
</pre>

####<a id="problem"></a> Define the Problem or Enhancement ####

It is critical for the Pivotal EAP team to understand the nature and scope of 
the problem that you are experiencing, so, when opening an issue, please 
provide a detailed and complete description of the problem. We suggest that you 
include as much of the following information as possible.  

* A brief description of the problem or enhancement request. Try to describe 
the symptoms clearly, carefully, and using proper terminology.

* Include details about any relevant recent changes to the platform, like job 
settings, IaaS changes, etc.

* Indicate any articles that you have already read and any troubleshooting 
steps that you have already taken.

* Indicate the impact and scope of this issue on your platform or the 
enhancement request you’d like to make.
  * If this is an issue, is the whole platform down or just part of it? Is one application failing or are all applications failing? Is one app failing to push or are multiple? 
  * If this is an enhancement request, can you describe what the goal of the enhancement is? What’s the ideal workflow you’d like to see?

Properly conveying the impact and scope of the problem you are seeing or the 
exact enhancement you are looking for will help the Pivotal EAP team to focus in 
on the specific issue more quickly.

####<a id="supporting_info"></a> Include Supporting Information ####

Please include the following information when relevant:

* List the software and full version numbers (x.y.z) you use. For <%= vars.product_name %>, this  includes at least the version of Ops Manager and PAS, but should also include any installed Service tiles and their versions.

* List your IaaS version information.

* Provide any relevant details about the environment where you see the issue. 
For example, tell us about the load balancer you're using, describe your 
network layout, provide details about your hardware and storage, and let us 
know about any non-standard or unsupported changes that have been made to the 
platform, such as running OSS CF, running without Ops Manager, or running 
custom tiles.

  <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: This should always be a sandbox, testing, or pre-prod environment.</p>
  
* Include the **exact** message for any errors that you are seeing. Either copy 
and paste the message, or include a screenshot of it.

* Post screenshots of the Status page for each tile deployed in Ops Manager or 
the output of `bosh vms --details`. For more information about the `bosh vms` 
command, see the [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#vms) 
topic.

* If any VMs on the Status pages are listed in red or if `bosh vms` lists any 
VMs as **failing**, obtain and attach logs from the problem VMs. For instructions to obtain logs, see [How to obtain logs from <%= vars.product_name %>](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Obtain-Logs-from-PCF) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.

* Specifically, do the following if you are having installation or upgrade 
problems:
  * Attach a copy of the most recent installation log.
  * If the installation fails to indicate that a particular BOSH task failed,
  run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER --debug`. If you use BOSH CLI v2+, run `bosh -e MY-ENV task TASK-NUMBER --debug`.
  * Attach the output of the `bosh task` command.

* Please also include the label **EAP** and a label for the most likely product 
of concern, for example, **pas** (formerly **elastic-runtime**), **redis**, **ops-manager**, etc.

## <a id="information"></a>Additional Information ##

Additional pointers for interacting with the Pivotal EAP Team Tracker projects:

* You can attach files up to 20M in size directly to an issue. You can attach 
files over 20M if you split them into 20M chunks, or, if you feel comfortable 
with it, you can add a link to a Google doc. If you are concerned about adding 
log files to your issue, leave them out and mention you can provide them in the 
issue.

* Use standard formats when sending information to Pivotal. Upload files as 
plain text, and screenshots in PNG, JPG, or PDF form. Whenever possible, do not 
use RTF or Microsoft Word documents.
