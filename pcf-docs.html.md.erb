Welcome to Pivotal Cloud Foundry Documentation!

## <a id="about-pcf"></a> What is Pivotal Cloud Foundry?

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is an enterprise platform for running and managing cloud-native apps and workloads. 

The PCF platform provides a layer of abstraction that:

- Lets platform operators manage shared resources on one or more cloud infrastructures.
- Hides the complexity of those infrastructures from developers delivering software on the platform.
- Optimizes resource usage and workload uptime.

PCF Operators manage the platform and its shared resources by using [Ops Manager](../customizing/ops-man.html).

### <a id="runtimes-services"></a> Runtimes and Services

PCF provides runtime environments for managing, hosting, and updating software workloads,
and software services for the hosted workloads to use.

Available runtimes are based on:

- Pivotal Application Service
- Pivotal Container Service (Kubernetes)

See [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Runtimes](../customizing/runtimes.html) for more information about PCF runtime environments.

See [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Add-Ons](https://docs.pivotal.io/#add-ons) for all Pivotal platform runtime and service documentation.

## <a id="role-based-guides"></a> Role-based Documentation

The documentation linked below explains how to work with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) based on your role. 

### <a id="new-users"></a> For New Users

For a general introduction to Pivotal runtimes and how they work, see the following:

* **PAS**

  - Theory: [Cloud Foundry Overview](../concepts/overview.html)
  - Practice: [Getting Started with PAS](../pas/intro.html)

    To try Pivotal Web Services, a PAS runtime hosted by Pivotal, follow the 15-minute tutorial [Getting Started with PCF](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry/).

* **PKS**

  - Theory: [What is Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) in the Kubernetes documentation
  - Practice: [Enterprise Pivotal Container Service (PKS)](../../runtimes/pks/index.html)

### <a id="platform-ops-arch"></a> For PCF Operators and Architects

PCF platform operators and architects assess PCF, plan network topologies, and determine PCF deployment needs. 
They also install, configure, upgrade, monitor, back up, troubleshoot, and generally maintain an existing PCF deployment.

For planning and installation documentation, see the following:

* [Architecture and Installation Overview](../installing/index.html)
* [Platform Architecture and Planning](../plan/index.html)
* [Platform Automation](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform-automation)

For documentation about managing PCF after initial deployment, 
see the [PCF Operator Guide](../opsguide/index.html).

### <a id="developers"></a> For Developers

Developers write and deploy apps, container workloads and functions to PCF. For developer documentation on PCF runtimes, see the following:

* **PAS**: [PAS Developer Guide](../devguide/index.html)
* **PKS**: [Using Enterprise PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/using.html)

### <a id="security"></a> For Security Professionals

Security professionals ensure that PCF platform is secure and 
comply with standard enterprise security best practices.

For security and compliance documentation, see the [PCF Security and Compliance Guide](../security/index.html).

### <a id="tile-dev"></a> For PCF Partner Tile Developers

Tile developers package software services as _tiles_ for easy integration into PCF.
Platform operators install the tiles through a GUI, which lets the developers on the platform use the services.

Tile developers publish tiles on Pivotal Network, where services and tiles are available for download.

For tile developer documentation, see the [PCF Tile Developer Guide](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/).
