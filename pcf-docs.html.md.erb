Welcome to Pivotal Cloud Foundry Documentation!

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a cloud-native platform for deploying and operating apps. Some people install and run the platform, others develop apps on it, and others manage the development teams or make sure that the platform is secure.

The guides linked below explain how you can do what you want with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) based on your role. Or see [Getting Started with PCF](../concepts/overview.html) for a general introduction to PCF and how it works.
