Welcome to documentation for <%= vars.platform_name %> and the
Tanzu Application Service runtimes.
This topic describes <%= vars.platform_name %> and provides documentation starting points for different <%= vars.platform_name %> users and perspectives.


## <a id="about-pcf"></a> What is the <%= vars.platform_name %> platform?

<%= vars.platform_name  %> is a multi-cloud enterprise platform for running, managing, and optimizing distributed apps and workloads. It offers runtime environments that manage containers using either Kubernetes or Diego.

The <%= vars.platform_name %> platform provides a layer of abstraction that:

* Lets platform operators manage shared resources on one or more cloud infrastructures.

* Hides the complexity of those infrastructures from developers delivering software on the platform.

* Optimizes resource usage and workload uptime.

Operators manage the platform and its shared resources by using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API, or Platform Automation. For more information, see [Using Ops Manager](../customizing/ops-man.html).

### <a id="runtimes-services"></a> Runtimes and Services

<%= vars.platform_name %> provides a platform for the runtime environments and
software services for the hosted workloads to use.
The runtime environments manage, host, and update software workloads.

Available runtimes are:

- <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>)
- <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>)
- <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>)
- <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> &#91;Small Footprint&#93;

For more information about runtime environments, see [Ops Manager Runtimes](../customizing/runtimes.html).

For runtime and service documentation, see [VMware Tanzu Docs](https://docs.pivotal.io/#add-ons).

## <a id="start-here"></a> Where to Start in the Documentation

The most relevant places to start in this documentation depend on the roles you expect to fulfill
with <%= vars.platform_name %>, its runtimes, and services.

The topics linked below list documentation starting points for these roles:

- [New Users](#new-users)
- [Platform Operators and Architects](#ops-arch)
- [Developers](#dev)
- [Security Professionals](#security)
- [Tile Developers](#tile-dev)

### <a id="new-users"></a> For New Users

For a general introduction to <%= vars.platform_name %> runtimes and how they work, see:

* **<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>**
  * Theory: [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Overview](../concepts/overview.html)
  * Practice: [Getting Started with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../pas/intro.html)<br><br>
    To try Pivotal Web Services, a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> runtime hosted by VMware, follow the 15-minute tutorial [Getting Started with Tanzu Application Service](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry/).

* **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>**
  * Theory: [What is Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) in the Kubernetes documentation
  * Practice: [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>)](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/index.html)

### <a id="ops-arch"></a> For <%= vars.platform_name %> Operators and Architects

Platform operators and architects assess <%= vars.platform_name %>, plan network topologies, and determine <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment needs. They also install, configure, upgrade, monitor, back up, troubleshoot, and generally maintain an existing <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

For planning and installation documentation, see:

* [Architecture and Installation Overview](../installing/index.html)
* [Platform Architecture and Planning](../plan/index.html)
* [Platform Automation](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform-automation)

For documentation about managing <%= vars.platform_name %> after initial deployment, see the [Operator Guide](../opsguide/index.html).

### <a id="dev"></a> For Developers

Developers write and deploy apps, container workloads, and functions to <%= vars.platform_name %>. For developer documentation on <%= vars.platform_name %> runtimes, see:

* **<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>**: [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Developer Guide](../devguide/index.html)
* **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>**: [Using Enterprise <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/using.html)

### <a id="tile-dev"></a> For <%= vars.platform_name %> Tile Developers

VMware Tanzu partners develop their package software services as _tiles_ for easy integration into <%= vars.platform_name %>. Platform operators install the tiles through a GUI, which lets the developers on the platform use the services.

Tile developers publish tiles on VMware Tanzu Network, where services and tiles are available for download.

For tile developer documentation, see the [<%= vars.platform_name %> Tile Developer Guide](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/).
